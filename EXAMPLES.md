## Business Workflows

> Look up material number 100-100 using BAPI_MATERIAL_GET_DETAIL and summarize its properties.

> Get a list of all open purchase orders for plant 1000 — first find the right BAPI, then call it.

> Read table CDHDR (change document headers) for today and summarize what objects were changed.

## Multi-Step Tasks
